# Schedule
Created a usable daily planner with using HTML, JS, Bootstrap v5.2, and jquery

## Users are able to input goals or plans into planner and save to local storage
### Simply click the timeslot you would like to add a plan to, enter plan, and click the archive icon. Ones you refresh the page or come back at a later time, the data will be saved.

I added a key to indicate that the RED meant current task, GREEN meant upcoming task, and GREY means a past task.
